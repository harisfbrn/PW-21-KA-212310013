    <h1 style="color:blue;">Haifa Studio</h1>
    <p>A place for recording songs, band practice, and having fun</p>
    <p style="color:red;">Haifa was created because of a very attached desire and the merging of two names into one, like two people with the same tastes meeting in the world of music.
    </p>
    <p>Haifa studio provides musical instruments for rent, and a music studio. There is also a place for recording songs</p>
